Make sure that you have a Red Hat OpenShift cluster, and make sure that it meets the minimum scheduling capacity:

| Software | Memory (GB) | CPU (cores) | Disk (GB) | Nodes |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- |
| {{site.data.keyword.ke_notm}} | 20 | 8 | 25 | 2 |
| {{site.data.keyword.ta}} | 6 | 3 | 8 |  |
| **Total** | **26** | **11** | **33** | **2** |

If you do not have a cluster, create one and then return to the {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} page.

Also, ensure that you have the proper permissions:

| Product or action | Permission required |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| On the OCP cluster | Manager and Writer roles for 'Kubernetes Cluster' service |
| To assign the entitlement | Editor role for 'License and Entitlement' service |
| To install {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} | Manager role for the 'Schematics' service |

## Step 1. Configure your installation environment
{: step1}
Select a target cluster, and then select or type a name for your project in the **Project** field.

You can view existing installations of {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} by expanding **View existing installations**.

## Step 2. Configure your workspace
{: step2}
In this step, define how your installation is managed in a Schematics workspace.

You can type a name for the installation in the **Name** field, or use the default.  To view your existing resources,
see the [resource list page](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).

Select a resource group from the **Resource group** list, or use the default.  For more information on resource
groups, see [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups#bp_resourcegroups).

Enter any tags you want to use to organize this resource in the **Tags** field in a comma-separated list.  Tags can
contain special characters, which can be used in creating key-value pairs (e.g., key:value) for grouping related tags. Tags are visible across the account.

## Step 3. Complete the pre-installation
{: step3}
Run the preinstallation script. Only a cluster administrator can run the script. If you do not have the proper role on the cluster, click **Share link** to share the preinstallation script with your cluster administrator. Otherwise, click **Run script** to execute the script. Confirm that the script completed successfully.

## Step 4. Set the deployment values
{: step4}
Ensure that an entitlement is assigned.  If not, get an entitlement from IBM Passport Advantage.

Confirm your agreement to the Third-Party Service Agreements by checking the box.

Set the `consoleRoutePrefix` parameter.  This value is used as the subdomain in the URL for the {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} landing page; the remainder of the URL is the OpenShift Cluster Console URL.

## Step 5. Install the Cloud Pak
{: step5}
Click **Install**.

## Step 6. Next steps
{: step6}
After the installation completes, links to your {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} landing page, your Tekton Dashboard, and your {{site.data.keyword.ta_short}} UI are provided.  You can click the **View log** link and find them at the bottom of the log file, or through the UI:

1. Login to the OpenShift console.
1. Click **Service Catalog**, then select **Application Console**.  You should see several projects installed.
   - If you click the **kabanero** project, the Overview tab contains the URLs to the **icpa-landing** page and the **tekton-dashboard**.
   - If you click the **ta** project, the Overview tab contains the URL to the {{site.data.keyword.ta_short}} UI.


<!-- For code examples:
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.

	```
	Copyable example for this step.
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file.
	When displayed in the doc framework,
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as
			output with no copy button.
